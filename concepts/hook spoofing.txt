I recently came up with this but then was told that it already had been don in oubhack, but w/e

We all know the problem that anti cheats can just do hook.GetTable and ban you if you have a foreign hook
We could solve this problem by just detouring hook.GetTable, but that only works if run before the anti cheat

Another approach to this problem is hook spoofing: 
Basically we disguise ourselfves as a legal hook

Example: 
The gamemode adds a Think hook to call some random function
1. We just do hook.GetTable and see that there's a think hook and also whatt function it is pointing to
2. We remove the original hook but keep a reference to the function it was calling
3. We add a hook with the name of the hook we removed that calls a function that first calls our function with all args and then calls the original function

That way they will never know we edited a hook 

Pros: 
- Public anti cheats don't detect it atm

Cons: 
- there may not be a hook of the type we are trying to spoof
